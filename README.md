# **Bootcamp Challenge 1 - Horiseon**

## **Description**

This is a Web Dev Bootcamp challenge where I was asked to refactor a Webpage to include semantic HTML and improve the accessibility without affecting what the page will look like to the user.

*The page must not differ more thank 10% from the screenshot:*

*(Code privided has a footer which seems to be cropped out of this screenshot which was included in Bootcamp course material)*

This challenge really made me think about the structure of the HTML and some parts of the CSS provided, I had to do a small amout of research to on what tags would be best to use in what sections of code.

I feel like this challenge left me with a deeper understanding of semantic HTML structure and what improves the accessibility of web pages.
